# Multichannel Analyzer for Alpha Spectroscopy

This code is designed for data acquisition and realtime monitoring of the pulses coming from the Silicon PIN photodiode based detector.

## Hardware 
* A microcontroller. Tested with Arduino Uno, Mega, Due and also ESP32
* A TFT Display ST7735 is used with SPI interface. 
* DS3231 RTC Module for the time
* Two potentiometers for setting up dividers.


### To do
* Fix rotary encoder glitch for dividers.
* Optimize drawing histogram.
