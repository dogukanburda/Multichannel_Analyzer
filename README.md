# Multichannel Analyzer for Gamma Spectroscopy

This code is designed for realtime monitoring the pulses coming to the Silicon PIN based detector.

## Hardware 
* A microcontroller. Tested with Arduino Uno, Mega, Due and also ESP32
* A TFT Display with SPI interface. ST7735 is used
* DS3231 RTC Module for the time
* Two potentiometers for setting up dividers.


### To do
* Fix rotary encoder glitch for dividers.
* Optimize drawing histogram.
